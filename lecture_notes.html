                    <b>Torch</b> is currently one of the most popular deep learning frameworks in top research labs around the world, such as Facebook and Google especially DeepMind.
                    Torch started from <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/">Y. LeCun's</a> lab, who is one of the leading experts in deep learning and <b>the</b> reference when working with convolutional neural networks.
                    In Torch there is a great array of existing codes, deep learning softwares and components that will make your life easy, especially once you successfully complete this course.

                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">
                    Torch sits on top of an existing programming language, <b>Lua</b>.
                    Lua is a lightweight, very fast multi-paradigm programming with a somewhat "Matlab"-like coding style.
                    Torch and Lua are rich in features and relatively easy to use and, therefore, are ideal for rapid prototyping.
                    However, they can be quite annoying in the beginning, because of some peculiarities.
                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">
                    Although Torch does not come with a graphical interface that would allow for easier programming, it does have a web interactive interface, namely <b>iTorch</b>.
                    For those of you familiar with <a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebooks for iPython, this should be quite easy.
                    Jupyter has implemented a Torch kernel, therefore, one can easily run torch software interactively on his/her web-browser as if he was running Matlab.
                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">
                    For those of you not familiar with Jupyter notebooks,

                    <i>
                    The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">
                    The great thing about Jupyter notebooks is that you can start them as easily as just typing <tt>itorch notebook</tt> in your terminal (of course once you have iPython and iTorch installed).
                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">
                    Next, we will guide you through the installation process and provide you with some short tutorial in Lua, and a longer tutorial in Torch.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Installing Lua and Torch</h3>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">
                    You do not need to explicitly install Lua, just install Torch and everything is going to work just fine.
                    To install Torch, <a href="http://torch.ch/docs/getting-started.html">please visit their website and follow the instructions.</a>
                    Although the basic installations are alright, you might experience some complications because of prior iPython installations.
                    In that you case you might need to rename some library files in the iPython installation (such libreadlince.* to something else -- do not delete them as you might need to bring them back in the future)
                    In any case, the installation should not take more than a few minutes if everything goes smoothly, or an hour if you have difficulties.
                    If you have difficulties that you cannot resolve, please <a href="http://lmgtfy.com/">lmgtfy</a> or ask a question in our virtual class in <a href="index.html#course-links">Piazza</a>.
                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">

                    At this point we have to note that Torch is mainly supported for X systems (Linux, OS X), but not Windows.
                    For those that cannot live without Windows for some reason, or that cannot have a separate partition where they install Ubuntu or Linux Mint, go to <a href="http://cilvr.nyu.edu/doku.php?id=software:torch:start#torch_tutorial_for_machine_learning">LeCun's NYU research group website</a>.
                    The simplest solution is to download this <a href="http://data.neuflow.org/share/Torch7.ova">Ubuntu virtual machine</a> they have prepared, which includes a pre-compiled, pre-installed version of Torch.
                    This virtual machine requires <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>.

                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">

                    Once you have the basic Torch installation, you shoule install additional Torch packages that are very useful for this course and beyond.
                    To install new Torch packages one simply needs to type in his terminal <tt>luarocks install MyNewPackage</tt>.

                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">

                    There are several useful or even necessary packages that you should now install: <tt>nn</tt>, <tt>gnuplot</tt>, <tt>optim</tt> and of course <tt>itorch</tt>.
                    For more packages you can visit the <a href="https://github.com/torch/torch7/wiki/Cheatsheet">Torch cheatsheet</a>.

                    </p>

                    <h4 class="section-heading">FAQ</h4>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Starting with Lua</h3>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">

                    There are dozens of tutorials for Lua out there.
                    Please, be patient enough to go through at least one, as there are certain Lua peculiarities that might make your life miserable, if you do not know them in advance.
                    Some tutorials that we found useful were the following:

                    </p>
                    
                    <p class="running-text">
                    <div align="left">

                    <ul class="running-text">
                    <li><a href="http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/" *-target="_blank">http://tylerneylon.com/a/learn-lua/</a></li>

                    </ul>

                    </div>
                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">

                    Once you read these tutorials, you should be able to start some basic programming with Lua.
                    Before continuing, you should be confident in understanding the following concepts.<br><br>

                    <b>Defining new variables with <tt>=</tt> &nbsp; </b> The <tt>local</tt> works <u>like</u> in Python and <u>unlike</u> Matlab.
                    This means that once you declare a variable <tt>myvar = 10</tt> and then you define another variable <tt>myvar2 = myvar</tt>, the <tt>myvar2</tt> actually refers to the memory address of <tt>myvar</tt>.
                    Hence, if you change <tt>myvar2</tt>, also <tt>myvar</tt> will change.
                    If you want a clean fresh variable you should use <tt>copy()</tt>. <br><br>

                    <b>The keyword <tt>local</tt> &nbsp; </b> The <tt>local</tt> keyword is a very important concept to understand.
                    In Lua by default all variables are declard global, unless you add the keyword <tt>local</tt> in front, like <tt>local myvar = 10</tt>.
                    Although this might look like an innocent mistake, it can create complete chaos in combination with the <tt>=</tt>.
                    If you don't define you variable to be local inside your function <tt>fun1</tt> (e.g., you just type <tt>num_epochs=10</tt>), and accidentally (or not) have the same variable name in other functions <tt>funOthers</tt>, changing <tt>num_epochs</tt> in <tt>fun1</tt> will also affect the same variable in <tt>funOthers</tt>. 

                    Also, note that local variables only exist in standalone scripts that one runs from the terminal.
                    If you just start an interactive session with <tt>th</tt> or with iTorch, local variables do not make sense.
                    If you define one, you will simply not be able to access it. <br><br>

                    <b>Lua <tt>table</tt> &nbsp; </b> Lua does not have lists, arrays, dictionaries and all the exotic variations of "keeping things together in a single variable", like Python.
                    Instead, it has tables (and metatables), with which one can do pretty much the same things.
                    One can iterate of the table elements with <tt>ipairs</tt>.<br><br>

                    <b>The keyword <tt>require</tt> &nbsp; </b> The <tt>require</tt> keyword works like <tt>import</tt> in Python, namely to import packages to your script/function/file.
                    Beware that the same rules apply about the <tt>local</tt> keyword.
                    Unless you want the package to be accessible by all files, use the <tt>local</tt>.<br><br>

                    <b>Difference between <tt>a.f()</tt> and <tt>a:f()</tt> &nbsp; </b> <b>NOTE READY YET.</b>
                    With <tt>a.f()</tt> you need to explicitly add the function itself as first argument, with tt>a:f()</tt> this is implicitly added.

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="section-heading">Starting with Torch</h3>


                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">

                    Torch is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms.
                    A basic component for machine learning and scientific programming are vectors, arrays, matrices, etc. 
                    Torch generalizes in an efficient manner vectors (1-d) and matrices (2-d) to tensors <tt>torch.Tensor()</tt> of n-dimensions.
                    By calling <tt>t = torch.Tensor(2, 3, 4, 5, 6)</tt> you get a new 5-d tensor <tt>t</tt>.

                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">
                    There are some nice tutorials out there about Torch. Consider some of the following:
                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text">
                    <div align="left">

                    </div>
                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">
                    The two single most important classes of objects in Torch is the <a href="https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/doc/tensor.md">tensor</a> and <a href="https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/doc/maths.md">maths</a>.
                    The tensor class provides all sorts of functionalities for manipulating vectors, matrices and tensors.
                    The math class provides all sorts of mathematical functions necessary in every scientific programming framework.

                    </p>

                    <p class="running-text" style="text-align:justify">

                    In large scale machine learning research memory and computational efficiency can be of paramount importance.
                    With Torch one can achieve high efficiency if one performs as many operations as possible in-place.
                    This means, you should try to avoid to define/call new variables, if you can reuse existing ones.
                    Through specialized functions Torch allows this to be done quite easily.
                    For example consider the following two cases.
                    </p>

                    In the first example a new variable, <tt>t3</tt>, is defined and new memory needs to be allocated.
                    If, however, <tt>t</tt>, is not needed anymore, we can just overwrite it to store the final summation.
                    As a result, we avoid allocating new resources.
                    Although this example is trivial, you might want to rethink it when you have matrices with millions of entries.
                    In general there are specialized functions for avoiding to performing specific tensor operations manually.
                    For example <tt>torch.expand([...])</tt> expands a tensor without allocating memory and <tt>torch.fill([...])</tt> fills in matrix entries without needing to run a for loop.

                    Although understanding things in theory are important, to become experts you need to start playing with code and programming.
                    We have prepared the <a href=practicals.html#practical-1>first practical</a> so that you familiarize yourself better with Lua and Torch, and more specifically with using tensors, writing functions, calling important packages like <tt>optim</tt> and <tt>itorch.Plot</tt>.
